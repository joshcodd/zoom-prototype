# Zoom Prototype 
As part of an assignment for the module Human Computer Interaction at univeristy I was tasked with designing and prototyping a improvement to zoom. The main issue I found with my experience of using Zoom for online teaching was the highly active and off topic chat, in which questions for the lecturer would be missed.

#### My prototype includes a real time chat, along with the following improvements:
- Seperate general and questions chat feeds.
- Up-vote and down-vote questions.
- Top 3 voted questions are always displayed underneath the hosts view.
- Questions are read out (text to speech) at a specified amount of votes.
- The host settings allow the lecturer to set the amount of votes questions are read at.
- The student settings alows the student to hide the general chat to avoid distractions.

This prototype had a quick turn around time and did not actually have to be an implementation. The aim for this was to demo the improvement made.
