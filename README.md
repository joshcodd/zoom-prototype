# Zoom Prototype 
As part of an assignment for the module Human-computer interaction at university, I was tasked with designing and prototyping an improvement to Zoom, the video conferencing software we currently use for online lectures. The main issue I found with my experience of using Zoom for online teaching was the highly active and off-topic chat, in which questions for the lecturer would be missed.

#### My prototype includes a real-time chat, along with the following improvements:  
- Separate general and questions chat feeds.
- Up-vote and down-vote questions.
- The Top 3 voted questions are always displayed underneath the host's view.
- Questions are read out (text to speech) at a specified amount of votes.
- The host settings allow the lecturer to set the amount of votes questions are read at.
- The student settings allow the student to hide the general chat to avoid distractions.

This prototype had a quick turn around time and did not actually have to be implemented. The aim for this was to demo the improvement made.
